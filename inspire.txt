Believe in yourself.
Know what you truly want.
Just make a ToDo List now,alright?
For a man is man and master of his fate.
Knowledge makes humble,ignorance makes proud.
A man's best friends are his ten fingers.
The good seaman is known in bad weather.
The only limit to realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
